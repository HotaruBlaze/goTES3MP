# goTES3MP for TES3MP
**This is still heavily in development and may be scrapped at 
anytime.**

This is an attempt at creating a wrapper for tes3mp-server requiring minimal or automated updates/changes to TES3MP scripting.

# Goal
Create a system for logging and manipulating tes3mp server output using only the console output. While having a system modular enough to expand and add features.
